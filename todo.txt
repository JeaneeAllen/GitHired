Reducer for apply/decline buttons
Reducer for job info similar to:
        const customerInfo = (state = {
            customer_name: '',
            street_address: '',
            city: '',
            zip: ''
            }, action) => {
        if (action.type === 'SET_CUSTOMER_INFO') {
                return action.payload
            }
        return state
            }

*Be sure to add reducers to root.

Updates to features:
-Possibly change the save button to turn green and/or toggle to allow users to remove or unselect the listing
-Move the redirect url to the MyJobs page
-Have jobs display on DOM when page loads.
